  title: Analytics Links REST API
  version: '7.0'
  description: |
    The Analytics Links REST API is provided by the Analytics service.
    This API enables you to manage the links to remote Couchbase clusters and external data sources.

    The API schemes and host URLs are as follows:

    * `http://node:8095/`
    * `https://node:18095/` (for secure access)

    where `node` is the host name or IP address of a node running the Analytics service.

produces:
  - application/json

consumes:
  - application/x-www-form-urlencoded
