  title: Analytics Service REST API
  version: '7.0'
  description: |
    The Analytics Service REST API is provided by the Analytics service.
    This API enables you to run Analytics queries and set request-level parameters.

    The API schemes and host URLs are as follows:

    * `http://node:8095/`
    * `https://node:18095/` (for secure access)

    where `node` is the host name or IP address of a node running the Analytics service.

produces:
  - application/json

consumes:
  - application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  - application/json
